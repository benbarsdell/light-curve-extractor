=====================

A C library for extracting light curves from (pre-identified) sparse sources in image sequences.

About
-----
Light Curve Extractor (liblce) is a C library for extracting light curves from
(pre-identified) sparse sources in image sequences. Computations are accelerated
using NVIDIA GPUs via CUDA.

Light curve extraction has applications in neural imaging, transient
astronomy and hopefully other fields too.

If you find the library useful, or have any questions or suggestions, please
get in touch with me!
